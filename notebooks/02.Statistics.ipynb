    "## Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Population**  \n",
    "A population is any large collection of objects or individuals, such as Americans, students, or trees about which information is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter**  \n",
    "A parameter is any summary number, like an average or percentage, that describes the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample**  \n",
    "A sample is a representative group drawn from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistic**  \n",
    "A statistic is any summary number, like an average or percentage, that describes the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Descriptive statistics** is the branch of statistics that involves organizing, displaying, and describing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inferential statistics** is the branch of statistics that involves drawing conclusions about a population based on information contained in a sample taken from that population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic quantities\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of means (arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, ...), but for most purposes we will be using the arithmetic mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantiles and median\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.hackmath.net/images/quartiles.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the 50% quantile (\"the middle quantile\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is the measure of how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Var(X) = E\\left[ (X - \\mu)^2 \\right] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Square root of the variance. Useful because it's expressed in the same units as the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$SD(X) = \\sigma_X = \\sqrt{E\\left[ (X - \\mu)^2 \\right]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "A measure of how two (random) variables vary with respect to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$cov(X,Y) = E\\left[ \\left( X-E[X] \\right) \\left( Y-E[Y] \\right) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "For a series of values, the process of standardization involves subtracting the mean to each values and dividing it by the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X_{\\text{standard}} = \\frac{X - \\mu_x}{\\sigma_X}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation is the standardized covariance (or the covariance of standardized variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$corr = \\frac{cov(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y} = cov \\left( \\frac{X-E[X]}{\\sigma_X},\\frac{Y-E[Y]}{\\sigma_Y}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation can be quite useful because it is adimensional and $-1 \\leq corr(X,Y) \\leq 1$."
